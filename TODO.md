# Waffle Bot
My Discord Bot :)

### Stuff to Look at and Possibly Implement
- [ ] Look at adding premium users
    - [ ] Add a database that tracks all premium users/regular users.
- [ ] Look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice
- [ ] Implement https://github.com/dipu-bd/lightnovel-crawler
    - [ ] Limit non-premium users to 1 watched novel and 10 chapters per hour to prevent rate limiting and save resources. (May not implement)
### Completed Stuff âœ“
- [x] Basic Command Handling
