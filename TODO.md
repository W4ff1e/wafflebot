# Waffle Bot
My Discord Bot :)

### Stuff to Look at and Possibly Implement
- [ ] Look at adding premium users
    - [ ] Add a database that tracks all premium users/regular users.
- [ ] Look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice
- [ ] Implement https://github.com/dipu-bd/lightnovel-crawler
    - [ ] Limit non-premium users to 1 watched novel and 10 chapters per hour to prevent rate limiting and save resources. (May not implement)
- [ ] Docker Environment Variables for tokens, instead of passing a bind mount to a config.json file.
### Completed Stuff âœ“
- [x] Basic Command Handling


Implement The following script:

python.exe lncrawl -q "novel-name" --first 1 --add-source-url --format PDF --suppress
